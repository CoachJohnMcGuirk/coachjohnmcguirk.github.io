								<p>In 2008 I moved from New York City out to Colorado and started doing video work for NetDevil marketing.  NetDevil was an expanding game studio specializing in MMOs.  In addition to Jumpgate: Evolution, NetDevil had been contracted to make an MMO for LEGO, which came to be known as LEGO Universe.</p>
								<p>Initially the game was in its early stages and a lot was still being worked out, however I filled this time by getting acquainted with the virtual camera controls and tools inside the game to record check-in videos as well as recording playtests which were held once a week. I even worked on some of the in-game cinematics.</p>
								<span class="image right"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/562635036?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0#t=0m05s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>
								<p>Bit by bit the game was becoming more polished, more complete, and deadlines were approaching.  Marketing started ramping up and one of the first public trailers we created internally for the public was the 'Build Trailer' which showcased claiming a property and building on it with friends.  Media Coordinator Chris Brubaker was my cohort on the media team and he and I worked together to storyboard this video and then wrangle the people we needed to capture the shots we needed.  At one point my brothers were in town and we even stuck them in front of some computers to help us out with the captures.</p>
								<span class="image left"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/562633571?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0#t=0m05s" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>
								<p>I had a steady stream of video requests and work at this point, but one idea I was really enthusiastic about was using my visual effects background to make some short videos for YouTube of vignettes showing life around the NetDevil offices.  One of the results was the "Soccer" video.  I really wanted to make these videos with fully 3D LEGO assets in Maya, but there was really not enough time to do so.  My compromise was to record the LEGO elements in the LEGO Universe engine on a special green screen level that the developers had made for us.  The results were the videos "Soccer", "Dancing", and "Pets".</p>
								<span class="image right"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/557450287?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></span>
								<p>Eventually NetDevil was bought by Gazillion Entertainment and LEGO Universe launched.  I created trailers and teasers for launch usually in collaboration with Chris, Capture Artist Warren Fligg, and the in-house audio team.  After launch LEGO purchased the LEGO Universe team from Gazillion and I was among those who went to work for LEGO.  I continued to support the game by making trailers for content updates, the last of which was the "Ninjago" update based on the sets and show.  We had a strange obsession with the theme song from the show so naturally Chris managed to get approval from LEGO for us to use the song for our trailer.  I worked on the captures and edit while Cassie Brubaker provided the motion graphics.</p>								
								<p>Soon after this trailer launched, LEGO decided to shut down LEGO Universe and our studio.  It was devastating to have to leave my dream job, but the experience, friendships, and work from that time will always be special to me.  I loved getting to work with such an incredibly smart, resilient, and talented group!</p>
